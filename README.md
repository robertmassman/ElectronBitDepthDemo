# ElectronBitDepthDemo
This is a small demo for the electron team that hopefully allows them to look into why 
after Electron version "17.4.11" 4-bit GPU filtered images look like 8-bit images after a gaussian filter is applied.

After installing dependencies and devDependencies 
To load the demo use the below.
npm run start

If you make changes to the code use the below to compile and then load the demo use the below.
npm run compile && npm run start

You can now use the dropdown to switch between image resolutions. The second image in the dropdown has a resolution of 512 x 512. 

Two Notes 

1.When switching to Electron “22.2.0” the image does not generate a preview automatically. Just move the gaussian blur slider to get a filtered image to appear.

2.In the file located at ElectronBitDepthDemo/src/filters/gaussianFilter.js. I noticed, when using Electron “17.4.11”, if I do not use the "drawCall_ImageThroughPut" filter fragment and output the image to the screen immediately after blurring it I get similar image results. similar to when updating Electron to “22.2.0” with the "drawCall_ImageThroughPut" fragment filter enabled.
